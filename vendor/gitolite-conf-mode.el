;; gitolite-conf-mode.el --- major-mode for editing gitolite config files 
;;
;; Provides navigation utilities, syntax highlighting and indentation for 
;; gitolite configuration files (gitolite.conf)
;;
;; Add this code to your .emacs file to use the mode (and automatically
;; open gitolite.conf files in this mode)
;;
;; (setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name "/directory/path/to/gitolite-conf-mode.el/") load-path))
;; (require 'gl-conf-mode)
;; (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("gitolite\\.conf\\'" . gl-conf-mode))
;;
;; If the file you want to edit is not named gitolite.conf, use
;; M-x gl-conf-mode, after opening the file
;;
;; Automatic indentation for this mode is disabled by default.
;; If you want to enable it, go to Customization menu in emacs, 
;; then "Files", "Gitolite Config Files", and select the appropiate option.
;;
;; The interesting things you can do are:
;; - move to next repository definition: C-c C-n
;; - move to previous repository definition: C-c C-p
;; - go to the include file on the line where the cursor is: C-c C-v
;; - open a navigation window with all the repositories (hyperlink enabled): C-c C-l
;; - mark the current repository and body: C-c C-m
;;
;;
;; Please note, that while it is not required by the license, I would
;; sincerely appreciate if you sent me enhancements / bugfixes you make
;; to integrate them in the master repo and make those changes accessible
;; to more people
;;
;; Now the MIT license block (this enables you to use this code in a 
;; very liberal manner)
