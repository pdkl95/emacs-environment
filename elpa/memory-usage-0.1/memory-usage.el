;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides the command `memory-usage', which lists all
;; buffers and how much memory they use.

;;; Code:

(defvar memory-usage-word-size (ceiling (/ (log most-positive-fixnum 2) 8))
  "Size of a Lisp word box in bytes.")

(defun memory-usage-buffer-size-bytes (b)
  "Return total number of bytes in the buffer contents."
  (with-current-buffer b
    (save-restriction
      (widen)
      (- (position-bytes (point-max)) (position-bytes (point-min))))))

(defun memory-usage-buffer-gap-bytes (b)
  "Return total number of bytes in the buffer gap."
  (with-current-buffer b
    (gap-size)))

(defun memory-usage-buffer-total-bytes (b)
  "Return total number of ralloc bytes used by buffer."
  (with-current-buffer b
    (save-restriction
      (widen)
      (+ (position-bytes (point-max))
	 (- (position-bytes (point-min)))
